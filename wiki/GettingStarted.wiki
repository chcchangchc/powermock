== API's == 
PowerMock consists of two extension API's. One for EasyMock and one for Mockito (which is currently in its infancy). To use PowerMock you need to depend on one of these API's as well as a test framework. Currently PowerMock only supports JUnit. There are three different JUnit test executors available, one for JUnit 4.4+, one for JUnit 4.0-4.3 and one for JUnit 3.

== Writing tests ==

Write a test like this:

{{{
@RunWith(PowerMockRunner.class)
@PrepareForTest( { YourClassWithEgStaticMethod.class })
public class YourTestCase {
...
}
}}}

Sample code is available in subversion:
 * [http://code.google.com/p/powermock/source/browse/trunk/modules/module-test/powermock/junit4-test/src/test/java/samples/junit4/singleton/MockStaticTest.java Mocking static methods]
 * [http://code.google.com/p/powermock/source/browse/trunk/modules/module-test/powermock/junit4-test/src/test/java/samples/junit4/expectnew/ExpectNewDemoTest.java Expect new instance]
 * [http://code.google.com/p/powermock/source/browse/trunk/modules/module-test/powermock/junit4-test/src/test/java/samples/junit4/suppressconstructor/SuppressConstructorDemoTest.java Suppress constructor]

JUnit 3 requires a different setup by creating a suite, since test runners are not available. Please view some examples:
 * [http://code.google.com/p/powermock/source/browse/trunk/modules/module-test/powermock/junit3-test/src/test/java/samples/junit3/privateandfinal/PrivateFinalTest.java Mocking private methods with JUnit 3]

 Download the [http://powermock.googlecode.com/files/powermock-1.2.5-with-dependencies.zip zip-file] with PowerMock and all its dependencies and add those to your project.

 You could also download the [http://powermock.googlecode.com/files/powermock-1.2.5-full.jar jar-file] with all PowerMock code in a single file and then download the dependencies separately.
