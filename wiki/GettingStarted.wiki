== API's == 
PowerMock consists of two extension API's. One for EasyMock and one for Mockito. To use PowerMock you need to depend on one of these API's as well as a test framework. Currently PowerMock only supports JUnit. There are three different JUnit test executors available, one for JUnit 4.4+, one for JUnit 4.0-4.3 and one for JUnit 3.

== Writing tests ==

Write a test like this:

{{{
@RunWith(PowerMockRunner.class)
@PrepareForTest( { YourClassWithEgStaticMethod.class })
public class YourTestCase {
...
}
}}}

Sample code is available in subversion:
 * [http://code.google.com/p/powermock/source/browse/trunk/modules/module-test/powermock/junit4-test/src/test/java/samples/junit4/singleton/MockStaticTest.java Mocking static methods]
 * [http://code.google.com/p/powermock/source/browse/trunk/modules/module-test/powermock/junit4-test/src/test/java/samples/junit4/expectnew/ExpectNewDemoTest.java Expect new instance]
 * [http://code.google.com/p/powermock/source/browse/trunk/modules/module-test/powermock/junit4-test/src/test/java/samples/junit4/suppressconstructor/SuppressConstructorDemoTest.java Suppress constructor]

JUnit 3 requires a different setup by creating a suite, since test runners are not available. Please view some examples:
 * [http://code.google.com/p/powermock/source/browse/trunk/modules/module-test/powermock/junit3-test/src/test/java/samples/junit3/privateandfinal/PrivateFinalTest.java Mocking private methods with JUnit 3]


== Maven setup ==
 * [EasyMock_maven EasyMock maven setup]
 * [Mockito_maven Mockito maven setup]

== Non maven users ==
 
*EasyMock*

*Mockito* 

Download the [http://powermock.googlecode.com/files/powermock-1.3-with-mockito-dependencies.zip Mockito] zip-file with PowerMock and all its dependencies and add those to your project.

You could also download the [http://powermock.googlecode.com/files/powermock-1.3-full.jar jar-file] with all PowerMock code in a single file and then download the dependencies separately.
