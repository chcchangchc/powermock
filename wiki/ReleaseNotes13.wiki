= Release Notes for PowerMock 1.3 =

PowerMock 1.3 is one of biggest releases to date and there's been lots of changes both internally and externally.

== Non-backward compatible changes ==
*EasyMock API specific*
  * D


*Mockito API specific*

*Common*
  * PowerMock now changes the context class-loader to the MockClassloader which means that you don't need to use @PowerMockIgnore as often as before. This solves many issues with frameworks that creates new instances using reflection like log4j, hibernate and many XML frameworks. If you've been using PowerMockIgnore in your test you may need to remove it (or update the ignored package list) otherwise the test might fail.


== Other notable changes ==
*EasyMock API specific*


*Mockito API specific*
  * Mocking of static methods in final system classes now works

*Common*
  * Classes prepared for test in parent test classes are now automatically prepared for test as well. I.e. if Test Case A extends Test Case B and A prepares X.class and B prepares Y.class then both X and Y will be prepared for test. Before only X was prepared for test.
