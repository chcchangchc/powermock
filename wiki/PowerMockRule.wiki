= Bootstrapping using a JUnit Rule =
*Note: This is experimental and API may change in the future*

Since version 1.3.7 it's possible to bootstrap PowerMock using a [http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/07/junit-4.7-rules JUnit Rule] instead of using the PowerMockRunner and the RunWith annotation. This allows you to use other JUnit runners while still benefiting from PowerMock's functionality. You do this by specifying:

{{{
   @PrepareForTest(X.class);
   public class MyTest {
        @Rule
        PowerMockRule rule = new PowerMockRule();

        // Tests goes here
        ...
   }
}}}
