= Bootstrapping using a JUnit Rule =
*Note: This is experimental and API may change in the future. Our aim is that this should be the default way of bootstrapping PowerMock in the future.*

Since version 1.3.7 it's possible to bootstrap PowerMock using a [http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/07/junit-4.7-rules JUnit Rule] instead of using the PowerMockRunner and the RunWith annotation. This allows you to use other JUnit runners while still benefiting from PowerMock's functionality. You do this by specifying:

{{{
   @PrepareForTest(X.class);
   public class MyTest {
        @Rule
        PowerMockRule rule = new PowerMockRule();

        // Tests goes here
        ...
   }
}}}

== Using PowerMockRule with Maven ==
You need to depend on this project:
{{{
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.powermock.modules</groupId>
	<artifactId>powermock-module-junit4-rule</artifactId>
	<version>${powermock.version}</version>
	<scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
}}}
where `${powermock.version}` is the version of PowerMock you're currently using.
